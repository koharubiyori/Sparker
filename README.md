## Sparker

Sparker is an Android project that allows you to remotely execute power actions such as boot(by Wake-On-LAN), unlock, shutdown, and more on your computer.

For features other than boot, it is necessary to run Sparker's [host app](https://github.com/koharubiyori/Sparker-Host) in your computer.

If you do not want to install an extra app, you can still use it to wake your computer as a Wake-On-LAN client.
